    <p class="inter-regular">
      A blockchain is like a super-secure digital ledger that records
      transactions across multiple computers, making it nearly impossible to
      hack or cheat the system. Imagine it as a chain of blocks, where each
      block contains data about a transaction (like a payment or a contract).
      Once a block is added to the chain, it's virtually set in stone, and
      everyone in the network has a copy of the entire chain.

  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p class="inter-regular">
      To ensure the security of this digital ledger, blockchain uses
      cryptography – a fancy word for secret codes. Each block has a unique code
      called a "hash" that acts like a fingerprint. If someone tries to tamper
      with a block, the hash changes, and the entire network knows something's
      fishy.

  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p class="inter-regular">
      Unlike traditional databases managed by a single authority, a blockchain
      is decentralized, meaning the network is spread across multiple computers
      (called nodes). These nodes constantly verify and update the blockchain,
      making it nearly impossible for anyone to gain control over the system.

      But how do new transactions get added to the blockchain? Enter the miners!
      These are powerful computers that solve complex mathematical puzzles to
      verify and add new blocks to the chain. As a reward for their hard work,
      miners get a small amount of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum).

    <p class="inter-regular">
      Speaking of cryptocurrency, blockchain is the backbone of these digital
      currencies. Instead of relying on banks or governments, cryptocurrencies
      use blockchain to record and verify transactions securely and
      transparently.

      Imagine a world where money exists only in the digital realm, without any
      physical coins or notes. That's the idea behind cryptocurrency – a form of
      digital cash that allows secure online transactions without the need for a
      middleman like a bank.

  <div class="text">
    <p class="inter-regular">
      Unlike traditional currencies controlled by governments or banks,
      cryptocurrencies are decentralized – meaning they operate on a
      peer-to-peer network without a central authority. This democratizes the
      system, putting the power back in the hands of the people.

    <p class="inter-regular">
      To store and manage your cryptocurrency, you'll need a digital wallet – a
      secure software program that holds your private keys (like super-secret
      passwords) and allows you to send and receive tokens. But remember, lose
      your keys, and your crypto could be lost forever!

  <div class="text">
    <p class="inter-regular">
      In the world of cryptocurrencies and fungible tokens (like Bitcoin or
      Ethereum), each token is interchangeable – one BTC is worth the same as
      any other BTC. But NFTs are different – they're unique, one-of-a-kind
      digital assets that can represent anything from art to music, videos, or
      even tweets!

    <p class="inter-regular">
      Just like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are built on blockchain technology, which
      acts as a secure and transparent ledger for recording ownership and
      transactions. But instead of being interchangeable, each NFT has its own
      unique digital signature, making it verifiable and immutable.

    <p class="inter-regular">
      One of the most popular use cases for NFTs is in the world of digital art.
      By minting their artwork as an NFT, artists can create scarcity,
      authenticate their work, and receive royalties every time their NFT is
      sold or traded. The following graphs shows the most common NFT portals in
      the world. Data is presented by volume as well as monetary value.

      Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs represent a digital revolution,
      challenging traditional systems of ownership, value exchange, and trust.
      These decentralized technologies are democratizing access, empowering
      individuals, and introducing concepts like digital scarcity and unique
      asset ownership. As the world becomes increasingly digital, their
      importance will only grow, reshaping how we perceive and interact with
      currencies, assets, and authenticity. Embrace this revolution, for it's
      not just about technology but reimagining our relationship with the
      digital world.
